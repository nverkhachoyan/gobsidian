Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This space is a digital garden, a place where I'll share my thoughts, learnings, and explorations.

## What is a Digital Garden?

>[!info] 
>Unlike a traditional blog, a digital garden is a more organic and evolving space. Notes are interconnected, updated over time, and reflect a journey of learning rather than a series of finished articles. You'll find a mix of half-formed ideas, polished essays, and everything in between.

Feel free to explore the connections between notes using the [[Map of Content|wikilinks]]. You might discover some interesting paths!

I'm excited to share this journey with you.
