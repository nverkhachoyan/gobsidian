There's a unique pleasure in getting lost in a good book. It's a journey into other worlds, a conversation with the past, and a way to understand the present.

## My Reading Habits

I try to read every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. I find it's a great way to unwind and disconnect from the digital world. I usually have a fiction and a non-fiction book going at the same time.

Currently, I'm reading "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir and "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman.

This is all part of my effort to build a [[Habit of Lifelong Learning]].
