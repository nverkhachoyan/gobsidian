# `=this.file.name`
## Profile

Captain Harrag is a burly, grizzled man with a thick beard and only one leg—the other lost in a vicious encounter with sahuagin. Though he carries the air of a ruthless sea captain, Harrag possesses an unexpected depth of empathy and fairness. He has transformed his infamous pirate vessel, the Leviathan, into a well-known tavern at Neverwinter’s docks, offering food, drink, and dangerous company to anyone with coin.

Despite a dark past of raiding and pillaging, Harrag now operates under the quiet protection of Lord Neverember, who pardoned his crimes in exchange for loyalty and intel. It’s whispered that Harrag’s **own shadow was cursed into sentience** to spy on him—a rumor he neither confirms nor denies.

Harrag is fiercely protective of the Beached Leviathan, and he tolerates all manner of patrons so long as they don’t threaten his business or his people. Though seemingly retired, he still keeps a well-polished cutlass near his side—and he knows how to use it.
