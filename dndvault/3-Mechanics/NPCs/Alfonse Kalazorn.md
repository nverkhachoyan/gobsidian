# `=this.file.name`


Alfonse Kalazorn used to be the sheriff of Triboar, a town to the east, where he was known as Big Al Kalazorn. He retired a decade ago, but retirement didn't sit well with him. Looking for a new challenge, he claimed a plot of fertile land five miles east of Conyberry and turned it into a cattle and horse ranch. Later, he added a pig farm, chicken coops, vegetable gardens, corn fields, and an apple orchard. Most of his money comes from the sale of butter skullsâ€”lumps of butter cleverly molded into the shapes of humanoid skulls. He sells his butter skulls primarily in towns to the east, although a few make their way to Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin. Big Al's butter is made from the milk of Petunia, his prized cow.

 
Alfonse Kalazorn is a tall, burly man with a thick beard and a booming voice. Despite his intimidating appearance, he is known for his kind heart and generosity. He is always willing to help those in need, whether it's lending a hand on the ranch or standing up for justice in town.

Many travelers passing through Conyberry stop by Alfonse's ranch to purchase his famous butter skulls. They are not only delicious but also a unique souvenir to take home. Alfonse takes great pride in his work and enjoys chatting with customers about his creations.

Although he may have retired from law enforcement, Alfonse Kalazorn continues to serve as a pillar of the community. He is well-respected among the townsfolk for his hard work, honesty, and dedication to his craft. Whether he's wrangling cattle or crafting butter skulls, Alfonse Kalazorn is a true legend in the region.
