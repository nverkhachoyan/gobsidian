# `=this.file.name`
## Profile

The current overseer of the Tarmalune Trade House is a meticulous and calculating Shou human with a sharp tongue and sharper instincts. Though his true name is rarely spoken by locals—who refer to him simply as “Overseer”—he commands immense respect within the merchant circles of Neverwinter’s Docks.

He represents the powerful consortium of merchants who fled Tarmalune after the cataclysmic Spellplague and rebuilt their fortune abroad. His influence ensures that exotic goods flow steadily into the city, and that *his* contracts get signed first. Rivals in the docks fear him not for brute strength, but for the sheer precision of his business tactics.

The Overseer is polite but curt, offering no more than is required. Yet for adventurers who can ensure the safe delivery of goods—or the quiet removal of obstacles—he may be a valuable ally with deep pockets and deeper connections.
