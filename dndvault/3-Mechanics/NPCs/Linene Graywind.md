## Profile

The master of the [[Phandalin]] post of the [[3-Mechanics/Guilds and Groups/Lionshield Coster|Lionshield Coster]] is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind.  Within the Lionshield Coster, Linene sells weapons only to those she believes are not a threat to [[Phandalin]] 's safety and only after they have proven themselves trustworthy. Her no-nonsense attitude and keen eye for deception make her a formidable presence in the small town.

Linene takes her role as protector of Phandalin seriously, often working closely with the town's militia to ensure its safety. She has a reputation for being fair but firm, and many townspeople look up to her as a strong leader.

Despite her tough exterior, Linene has a softer side that she only shows to those she trusts. She is fiercely loyal to her friends and family, and will go to great lengths to protect them.

In addition to running the Lionshield Coster, Linene is also an accomplished warrior, skilled in both hand-to-hand combat and archery. Many adventurers passing through Phandalin seek out her services, knowing that she can provide them with quality weapons and valuable advice.

Linene Graywind may not be the most approachable person in Phandalin, but she is certainly one of the most respected. Her dedication to keeping the town safe has earned her the admiration of many, making her a true hero in the eyes of its residents..
