# `=this.file.name`
## Profile

The proprietor of Stonehill Inn.  He is a short, friendly male human named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining.

Toblen is known for his warm hospitality and willingness to help travelers passing through town. He takes pride in his inn and works hard to ensure that his guests are comfortable during their stay. Toblen is well-liked by the locals and often serves as a source of information about the town and its residents.

Despite not being a skilled miner, Toblen still keeps an eye out for potential opportunities in the nearby mines. He is always on the lookout for adventurers who might be willing to explore the dangerous areas surrounding Phandalin in search of treasure or valuable resources.

Toblen's inn is a popular gathering spot for both locals and visitors alike. The cozy atmosphere, hearty meals, and comfortable rooms make it a favorite place to relax and unwind after a long day of travel or work.
