## Profile

Madame Rosene is the dignified and warm-hearted matron of the Driftwood Tavern, a historical landmark in Neverwinter’s Docks District. Though in her 70s, she commands respect and admiration from locals, nobles, and historians alike. The tavern, once a shelter for refugees, now serves as a living museum of “Old Neverwinter,” with relics and memorabilia lovingly curated by Rosene herself.

Beneath her gentle demeanor lies the fire of a freedom fighter—Rosene was once the secret leader of the **Sons of Alagondar**, a rebel faction that opposed Lord Neverember’s rule. Though the Graycloaks eventually made peace, and many joined the army, Rosene continues to advocate for the people and keeps a close watch on politics behind her aging but sharp eyes.

She is a fountain of knowledge about Neverwinter’s past and will gladly share it with those who treat her and her tavern with respect. Adventurers may find her a valuable source of quests, historical context, or discreet alliances.
