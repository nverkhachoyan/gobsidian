## Profile

**Norbus Ironrune**, is an 88 year old, shield dwarf and mining prospector from the town of [[Phandalin]].  They are originally found by the PCs in the **Dwarven Excavation** alongside his long time companion and business partner [[Dazyln Grayshard]].  

**Norbus** is known for his incredible strength and endurance, which has allowed him to survive in the harsh conditions of the mines for decades. He is also a skilled blacksmith, able to craft some of the finest weapons and armor in the region.

Despite his advanced age, Norbus shows no signs of slowing down and is always eager to embark on new mining expeditions. He has a deep passion for uncovering rare ores and gems, believing that there are still many treasures waiting to be found deep within the earth.

Norbus is fiercely loyal to his friends and will go to great lengths to protect them. He has a gruff exterior but a kind heart, always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

As the PCs get to know Norbus better, they will uncover his tragic past - including the loss of his family in a mining accident many years ago. This event has haunted him ever since, driving him to seek solace in the depths of the earth.
