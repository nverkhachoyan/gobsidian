## Description

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The holy symbol of Abbathor is a golden coin with the face of a dwarf engraved on one side and the image of a blackened, clawed hand reaching out on the other. It symbolizes wealth, trickery, and the insatiable desire for material possessions that Abbathor embodies.  Around the edges of the amulet in dwarvish reads "Greed is good".

The coin is often worn as a pendant or amulet by followers of Abbathor, who believe that carrying it brings luck in business dealings and helps secure their financial success. The symbol is also used in rituals and ceremonies dedicated to Abbathor, where offerings of coins are made to appease the deity and seek his favor.
