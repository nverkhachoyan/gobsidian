# Tenser's Transformation
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a few hairs from a bull
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can't cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.  
- You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.  
- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra `dice: 2d12|avg|noform` (`2d12`) force damage.  
- You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.  
- You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.  
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.  

Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

**Classes**: [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
