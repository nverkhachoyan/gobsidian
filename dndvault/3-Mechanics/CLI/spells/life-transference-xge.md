# Life Transference
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature's injuries. You take `dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`) necrotic damage, which can't be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
