# Ray of Frost
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`) when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg|noform` (`2d8`)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg|noform` (`3d8`)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`)).
