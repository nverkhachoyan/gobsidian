# Staggering Smite
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra `dice: 4d6|avg|noform` (`4d6`) psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.

**Classes**: [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin.md), [Warlock (The Hexblade)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock-the-hexblade-xge.md)
