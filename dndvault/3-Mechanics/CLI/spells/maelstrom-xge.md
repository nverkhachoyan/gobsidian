# Maelstrom
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, paper or leaf in the shape of a funnel
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling mass of 5-foot-deep water appears in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range. The point must be on the ground or in a body of water. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take `dice: 6d6|avg|noform` (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and be pulled 10 feet toward the center.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid.md)
