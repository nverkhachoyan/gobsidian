# Calm Emotions
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md), [Paladin (Oath of Redemption)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin-oath-of-redemption-xge.md), [Sorcerer (Aberrant Mind)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-aberrant-mind-tce.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Warlock (The Archfey)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock-the-archfey.md)
