# Conjure Barrage
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, one piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 3d8|avg|noform` (`3d8`) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Battle Smith)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-battle-smith-tce.md), [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
