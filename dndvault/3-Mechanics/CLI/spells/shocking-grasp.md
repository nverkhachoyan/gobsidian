# Shocking Grasp
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`) lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`) when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg|noform` (`2d8`)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg|noform` (`3d8`)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`)).

**Classes**: [Artificer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
