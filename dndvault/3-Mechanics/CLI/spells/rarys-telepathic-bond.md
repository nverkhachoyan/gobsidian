# Rary's Telepathic Bond
*5th-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Peace Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-peace-domain-tce.md), [Sorcerer (Aberrant Mind)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-aberrant-mind-tce.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
