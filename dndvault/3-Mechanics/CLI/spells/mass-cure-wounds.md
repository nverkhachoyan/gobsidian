# Mass Cure Wounds
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to `dice: 3d8|avg|noform` (`3d8`) + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Battle Smith)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-battle-smith-tce.md), [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md), [Cleric (Life Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-life-domain.md), [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric.md), [Druid (Circle of Wildfire)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-wildfire-tce.md), [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
