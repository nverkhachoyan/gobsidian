# Adamantine Weapon
*GV|DMG, major, unknown*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Melee weapons made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an adamantine weapon hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

The adamantine version of a melee weapon costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon is made of the metal or coated with it.
