# Wand of Paralysis
*WD|DMG, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/DMG/Wand%20of%20Paralysis.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The wand regains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
