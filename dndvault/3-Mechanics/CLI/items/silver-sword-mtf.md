# Silver Sword
*Melee Weapon, major, unknown (magic) (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [astral projection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/astral-projection.md) spell), you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
