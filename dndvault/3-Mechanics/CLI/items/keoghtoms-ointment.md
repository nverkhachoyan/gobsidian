This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `dice: 1d4 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d4 + 1`) doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh ½ pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains `dice: 2d8 + 2|avg|noform` (`2d8 + 2`) hit points, ceases to be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and is cured of any disease.
