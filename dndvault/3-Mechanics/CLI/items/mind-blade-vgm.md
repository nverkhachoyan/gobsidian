# Mind Blade
*GV|DMG, rare (requires attunement by a specific individual)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Mind flayers can turn any nonmagical sword into a mind blade. Only one creature can attune to it: either a specific mind flayer or one of its thralls. In the hands of any other creature, the mind blade functions as a normal sword of its kind. In the hands of its intended wielder, the mind blade is a magic weapon that deals an extra `dice: 2d6|avg|noform` (`2d6`) psychic damage to any target it hits.
