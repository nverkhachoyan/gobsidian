# Sword of Wounding
*GV|DMG, major, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.
