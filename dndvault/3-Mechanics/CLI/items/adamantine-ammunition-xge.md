# Adamantine Ammunition
*GV|DMG, minor, unknown*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Ammunition made of or coated with adamantine is unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever a piece of adamantine ammunition hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

The adamantine version of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.
