- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges, and if a secret door or trap is within 30 feet of you, the wand pulses and points at the one nearest to you. The wand regains `dice: 1d3|avg|noform` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
