A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of "the Water Ashari", was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest. However, rumors swirl that she is seeking another hero to wield it—one who can travel the land and do good in small ways as she once did.

## Dormant

While the Spire of Conflux is in a dormant state, the staff has 8 charges and regains `dice: 1d4 + 2|avg|noform` (`1d4 + 2`) expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [burning hands](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/burning-hands.md) (1 charge) or [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md) (3 charges).

Additionally, while holding this staff, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC increases by 1.
