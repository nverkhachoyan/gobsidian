# Greater Silver Sword
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/MTF/Greater%20Silver%20Sword.webp#right)  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This magic weapon grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold the sword, you have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, you are immune to being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and you have resistance to psychic damage. In addition, if you score a critical hit with it against a creature's astral body, you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
