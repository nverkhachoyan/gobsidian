While wearing this ring, you regain `dice: 1d6|avg|noform` (`1d6`) hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 1`) days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
