# Horn of Silent Alarm
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This horn has 4 charges. When you use an action to blow it, one creature of your choice can hear the horn's blare, provided the creature is within 600 feet of the horn and not [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened). No other creature hears sound coming from the horn. The horn regains `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) expended charges daily at dawn.
