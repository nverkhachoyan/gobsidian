# Far Realm Shard
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/TCE/Far%20Realm%20Shard.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This writhing crystal is steeped in the warped essence of the Far Realm. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or take `dice: 3d6|avg|noform` (`3d6`) psychic damage and become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the start of your next turn.
