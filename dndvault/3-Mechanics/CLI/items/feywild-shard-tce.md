# Feywild Shard
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/items/TCE/Feywild%20Shard.webp#right)  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This warm crystal glints with the sunset colors of the Feywild sky and evokes whispers of emotional memory. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in the "Player's Handbook". If the result is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration), it doesn't require [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

If you don't have the Wild Magic Sorcerous Origin, once this property is used to roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
