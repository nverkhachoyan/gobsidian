# Appendix B: Sidekicks
*Source: Essentials Kit: Storm Lord's Wrath* 

This appendix presents the game statistics for sidekicks, of which there are three types:

- **Expert**, an agile and exceedingly helpful jack of all trades  
- **Spellcaster**, a magic-user who can cast spells to harm your foes or heal you and your friends  
- **Warrior**, a martial companion who specializes in striking your foes or defending you and your allies  

You can tell the players which type of sidekick to use or let the players choose. It's up to you and the players to decide who controls the sidekick in play.

If the characters have already played through Dragon of Icespire Peak, they can use the same sidekicks from that adventure. This appendix can also help you level up those sidekicks.
