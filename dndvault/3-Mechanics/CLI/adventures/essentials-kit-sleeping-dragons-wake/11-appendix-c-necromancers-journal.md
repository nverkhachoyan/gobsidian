# Appendix C: Necromancer's Journal
*Source: Essentials Kit: Sleeping Dragon's Wake* 

How does one woo a legendary dragon? Great treasure for certain. I wonder how Ebondeath might feel about the prospect of immortality.

Once my collegues in *cultus draconis* have prepared the proper rituals, we can take command of the wyrm and add its strength to our own. Then I, Ularan Mortus will command their respect as well as the fears of that pathetic alliance of lords.

If we can accomplish this, certainly no task shall be too great for a true devotee of the lord of bones. At that point, taking possession of the *artefact* from that ridiculous little berg of Leilon should be child's play.

The dreadnaught grows restless. Emberlost seeks hopelessly to be reunited with his fallen homeland of Anauria. How does one ease the obsessive behaviors of *eques mortem*? Particularly in its current state?

**Roadhouse? Could bard win him over**?
