## Spring-Eladrin

Their hearts filled with joy, spring eladrin cavort through their sylvan realms, their songs and laughter filling the air. These playful eladrin beguile other creatures to fill them with the joy of spring. Their antics can lead other creatures into danger and make mischief for them.

## Eladrin

Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane, and resemble them in both their love of beauty and the value they place on personal freedom. But where other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are creatures ruled by emotionâ€”and because of their unique magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament.

The eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become fey creatures as a result. Some of them are still humanoid, similar in that respect to their other elven kin. The eladrin presented here are of the fey variety.

## Creatures of Passion

The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and capabilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week.

## Lovers of Beauty

Regardless of the aspect they express, eladrin love beauty and surround themselves with lovely things. Eladrin try to possess any objects they find striking. They might seek to own a painting, a statue, or a glittering jewel. When they encounter people of comely form or luminous spirit, they use their magic to delight those folk or, in the case of evil eladrin, to abduct them.

## Changeable Nature

Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). When the eladrin makes this change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in its original form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.
