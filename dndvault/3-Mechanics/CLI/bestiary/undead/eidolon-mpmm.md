- "desc": "The eidolon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were\
    \ difficult terrain. It takes dice:1d10|text(5) (1d10) force damage if it\
    \ ends its turn inside an object other than a [sacred statue](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/sacred-statue-mpmm.md)."
  "name": "Incorporeal Movement"
- "desc": "When the eidolon moves into a space occupied by a [sacred statue](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/sacred-statue-mpmm.md),\
    \ the eidolon can disappear, causing the statue to become a creature under the\
    \ eidolon's control. The eidolon uses the [sacred statue's stat block](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/sacred-statue-mpmm.md)\
    \ in place of its own."
  "name": "Sacred Animation (Recharge 5-6)"
- "desc": "The eidolon has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns\
    \ Undead."
  "name": "Turn Resistance"
- "desc": "The eidolon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep."
  "name": "Unusual Nature"
"actions":
- "desc": "Each creature within 60 feet of the eidolon that can see it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ of it for 1 minute. While [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ in this way, the creature must take the [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash)\
    \ action and move away from the eidolon by the safest available route at the start\
    \ of each of its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case\
    \ the creature also becomes [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned)\
    \ until it can move again. A [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the\
    \ effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the\
    \ effect ends for it, the target is immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the\
    \ next 24 hours."
