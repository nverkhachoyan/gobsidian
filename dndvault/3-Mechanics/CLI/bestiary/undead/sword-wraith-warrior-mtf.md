## Sword Wraith

When a glory-obsessed warrior dies in battle without earning the honor it desperately sought, its valorâ€”hungry spirit might haunt the battlefield as a sword wraith.

## Brooding Spirits

The most likely spots for encountering sword wraiths are scenes of ancient ambushes, battlefields where soldiers were felled by magic with no chance to fight back, and sites where enemies were hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter.

## Honor Above All

Sword wraiths fly into a rage if anyone questions their valor. Conversely, they are easily appeased by praise. Little pleases them more than hearing a ballad performed in their honor. Towns located near ancient battlefields hold annual festivals of remembrance to keep sword wraiths there placated.

## Undead Nature

A sword wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
