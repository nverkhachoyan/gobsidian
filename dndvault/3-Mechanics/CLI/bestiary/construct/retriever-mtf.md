## Retriever

The retriever is a potent, spider-like construct conceived and built by the drow for one original purposeâ€”to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for the drow to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions.

## Demon-Infused

Although each retriever is a metal-and-magic construct, it houses the imprisoned spirit of a bebilith. Most of the demon's intellect has been distilled away, leaving only its cruelty and cunning.

## Lethal Collectors

Though they were created to operate only in the Abyss, retrievers are sometimes dispatched when a powerful drow needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to a non-drow, since the dark elves don't want to take the chance that the construct will be turned against them.
