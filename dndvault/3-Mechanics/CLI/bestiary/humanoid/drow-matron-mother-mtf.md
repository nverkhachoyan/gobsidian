## Drow Matron Mother

At the head of each drow noble house sits a matron mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with carrying out the god's will while also advancing the interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspiratorial web, with demons, drow, spiders, and slaves positioned between them and their enemies. Although matron mothers command great power, that power depends on maintaining the Spider Queen's favor, and the dark god sometimes capriciously takes back what she has given. The stat block here represents a matron mother at the height of her power.
