# [Leviathan](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\elemental/leviathan-mtf.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 198*  

## Leviathan

A towering wall of water that drags ships down to the ocean's depths and washes away coastal settlementsâ€”that phenomenon typifies the destruction a leviathan can unleash on the world. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water to form an immense serpent-shaped creature.

## Elder Elementals

On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.

## Deadly When Summoned

The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.

## Elemental Nature

An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    \nAt the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall appears, the wall,\

    \ when it moves must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or take dice:5d10|text(27)\
    \ (5d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage no more than once\
    \ on a turn. At the end of each turn the wall moves, the wall's height is reduced\
    \ by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the wall on subsequent rounds\
    \ is reduced by dice: 1d10|avg|noform (1d10). When the wall reaches 0 feet\
    \ in height, the effect ends.\n\nA creature caught in the wall can move by swimming.\
    \ Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful\
    \ DC 24 Strength ([Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check\
    \ to swim at all during that turn."
