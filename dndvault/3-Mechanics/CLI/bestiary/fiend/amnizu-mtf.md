# [Amnizu](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fiend/amnizu-mtf.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 164*  

Amnizus lead the infernal legions into battle and command guardians at the gateways to the Hells. Amnizus are arrogant, bullying, and ruthless, but they're also highly intelligent tacticians and unfailingly loyalâ€”qualities that the hellish archdukes value.

## Guarding the River Styx

Some amnizus perform the critical task of watching over the River Styx from fortresses along the river's blighted banks, where it flows through Dis and Stygia. Souls arriving in the form of [lemures](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md) have no personalities or memories; they're driven only by the desire to commit evil. The amnizus that patrol here drill the rules of the Nine Hells into the new arrivals' pitiful brains and marshal the lemures into legions.
