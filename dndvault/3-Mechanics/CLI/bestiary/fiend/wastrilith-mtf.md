## Wastrilith

Found in the waters of the Abyss and other bodies of water contaminated by the plane's fell influence, wastriliths establish themselves as lords of the deep and rule their dominions with cruelty.

## Despoilers

A wastrilith contaminates the waters around it. Its noxious presence even affects nearby sources of water when the demon travels on land. The corrupted water, which contains a measure of the demon's essence, responds to its commandsâ€”perhaps hardening to prevent foes from escaping, or erupting in a surge that drags would-be victims into its reach.

## Silent Corrupters

Creatures that ingest water that has been corrupted by a wastrilith risk their very souls. Those who drink the poisonous liquid might wither away until they finally die, or remain alive only to become a thrall of chaos and evil.

To represent this defilement, you can use the optional rule on planar effects||abyssal corruption from  in chapter 2 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide", causing the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature to be corrupted.
