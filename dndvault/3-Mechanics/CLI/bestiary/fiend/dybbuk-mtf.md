## Dybbuk

Dybbuks terrorize mortals on the Material Plane by possessing corpses and giving them a semblance of life, after which the demons use them to engage in a range of sordid activities.

## Puppet Masters

In their natural form, dybbuks appear as translucent flying jellyfish, trailing long tendrils as they move through the air. They rarely travel in this fashion, however. Instead, a dybbuk possesses the first suitable corpse it finds, rousing the body from death so it can then indulge its hideous vices.

## Dark Masquerade

By plundering a corpse's memories and accessing its capabilities, a dybbuk can impersonate the creature as it was in life. But the truth of the matter quickly becomes apparent to those around it, because a dybbuk can't resist pursuing its vices with a maniacal single-mindedness that betrays its true nature. Dybbuks delight in terrorizing other creatures by making their host bodies behave in horrifying waysâ€”throwing up gouts of blood, excreting piles of squirming maggots, and contorting their limbs in impossible ways as they scuttle across the ground.

- "desc": "The dybbuk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical\

  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "The dybbuk can use a bonus action while it is possessing a corpse to make\
    \ it do something unnatural, such as vomit blood, twist its head all the way around,\
    \ or cause a quadruped to move as a biped. Any beast or humanoid that sees this\
    \ behavior must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\

  "name": "Violate Corpse"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: dice: d20+6 (+6) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.\
    \ Hit: dice:2d8 + 4|text(13) (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is\
    \ a creature, its hit point maximum is also reduced by dice:1d6|text(3) (1d6).\
    \ This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target\
    \ dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0."
  "name": "Tendril"
- "desc": "The dybbuk disappears into an intact corpse it can see within 5 feet of\
    \ it. The corpse must be Large or smaller and be that of a beast or a humanoid.\
    \ The dybbuk is now effectively the possessed creature. Its type becomes undead,\
    \ though it now looks alive, and it gains a number of temporary hit points equal\
    \ to the corpse's hit point maximum in life.\n\nWhile possessing the corpse, the\
    \ dybbuk retains its hit points, alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, telepathy,\
    \ and immunity to poison damage, [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion),\
    \ and being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) and [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).\
    \ It otherwise uses the possessed target's game statistics, gaining access to\
    \ its knowledge and proficiencies but not its class features, if any.\n\nThe possession\
    \ lasts until the temporary hit points are lost (at which point the body becomes\
    \ a corpse once more) or the dybbuk ends its possession using a bonus action.\
    \ When the possession ends, the dybbuk reappears in an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the corpse."
