# Wood Elf Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 75*  

**Prerequisite**: [Elf (Wood)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/elf-wood.md)

You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [longstrider](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/longstrider.md) and [pass without trace](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/pass-without-trace.md) spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
