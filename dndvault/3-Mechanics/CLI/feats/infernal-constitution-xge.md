# Infernal Constitution
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 75*  

**Prerequisite**: [Tiefling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/tiefling.md)

Fiendish blood runs strong in you, unlocking a resilience akin to that possessed by some fiends. You gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to cold and poison damage.  
- You have advantage on saving throws against being [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).
