### Size

Gith are taller and leaner than humans, with most a slender 6 feet in height.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Gith.

### Alignment

Githyanki tend toward lawful evil. They are aggressive and arrogant, and they remain the faithful servants of their lich-queen, Vlaakith. Renegade githyanki tend toward chaos.

### Decadent Mastery

You learn one language of your choice, and you are proficient with one skill or "tool" of your choice. In the timeless city of Tu'narath, githyanki have bountiful time to master odd bits of knowledge.

### Martial Prodigy

You are proficient with light and medium armor and with [shortswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md), [longswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md), and [greatswords](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/greatsword.md).

### Githyanki Psionics

You know the [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip, and the hand is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) when you cast the cantrip with this trait.

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [jump](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/jump.md) once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md) spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. When you cast them with this trait, they don't require components.

## Description

The brutal githyanki are trained from birth as warriors.

The story of the gith is rooted in a cruel twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.

The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu'narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.

The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.

If the two races were ever to team up against the illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip the balance in their favor. But as long as the githyanki and githzerai stay at each other's throats, their goal of ultimate victory over their original common enemy will likely remain unachieved.
