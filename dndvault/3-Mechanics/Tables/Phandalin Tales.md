|----------|------|
| 1 | "Once again, the orcs have come down from the mountains to prey on the lowlands! If Neverwinter doesn't send help soon, the orcs will overrun Phandalin and destroy everything we've worked so hard to rebuild." |
| 2 | "As the Triboar Trail runs east, it passes through the ruins of Conyberry, a town sacked by barbarians years ago. There's a ruined temple south of Conyberry where it's said the locals hid their gold." (If the characters visit the temple, see "Shrine of Savras" on page 38.) |
| 3 | "Strange magic pervades Neverwinter Wood, confounding navigators and obscuring the ancient ruins of bygone kingdoms lost in its depths." |
| 4 | "Falcon's Hunting Lodge is the only safe haven in Neverwinter Wood. It lies deep in the forest along a river's edge, and wealthy nobles venture there to hunt while under Falcon's protection. Falcon is a retired veteran of many wars, and it's said he'll offer free room and board to anyone who brings him a bottle of wine." (If the characters pay Falcon a visit, see "Falcon's Hunting Lodge" on page 24.) |
| 5 | "West of Phandalin, on the coast, is an old stone lighthouse. Ships are drawn to this gleaming tower like moths to a flame, and are doomed to crash upon its rocks. Their wrecks must be filled with treasure!" (If the characters visit the lighthouse, see "Tower of Storms" on page 40.) |
| 6 | "Some folk claim to have seen a dragon flying through the high clouds. At that distance, it's hard to gauge the creature's size, but some say it's as big as an elephant and has gleaming white scales." |
