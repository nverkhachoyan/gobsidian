**Proprietor**: [[Captain Harrag]]

A grounded pirate ship converted into a large tavern and inn. It serves a mix of sailors, thugs, adventurers, and dockside regulars.

> [!readaloud]  
> "The scent of salt, sweat, and spiced rum fills the air as you step aboard the grounded remains of a massive pirate vessel. Wooden planks creak underfoot and the hull groans softly, as though the ship remembers the seas it once sailed. Lanterns swing gently from the beams, casting warm golden light over mismatched tables, weathered sailors, and walls decorated with barnacled trophies and faded nautical flags. A spiral staircase winds up through the center of the tavern, and you can hear the thrum of music and boisterous laughter drifting down from the upper decks."


## Staff (IMPORTANT)
> [!npc]- Feng (Male)
> A massive half-orc stands near the entrance, arms crossed and gaze unblinking. Feng silently watches every patron that comes and goes, his tusked face unreadable but intimidating.

> [!npc]- Andrella (Female)
> This no-nonsense human woman, affectionately called "Mate" by the crew, is behind the bar directing staff and watching the room like a hawk. A cracked tankard hangs from her belt—a trophy from an old tavern brawl.

> [!npc]- Tabnab (Male)
> The kitchen door swings open to reveal a lanky human man with wild hair and a sooty apron. He’s carefully seasoning a stew with spices no one recognizes—possibly not even him.

## Regulars
> [!npc]- Len-jes (Female)
> Sitting near a window overlooking the harbor, this scarred watersoul genasi quietly sips a mug of grog. Her sharp eyes follow the tides and the faces of every sailor who enters.

> [!npc]- Umi (Female)
> Leaning against a beam near the stairs, this athletic watersoul genasi sharpens her scimitar. She flicks her eyes up to meet yours and gives a subtle nod, acknowledging your presence.

> [!npc]- Bobrik Highmantle (Male)
> This stout dwarf bellows with laughter at the bar, slapping the counter and sending his pet monkey scampering along its length. His beard is braided with seashells and copper rings.

> [!npc]- Markul (Male)
> A wiry young human sits near the stairs with a half-finished drink and a bored expression. He idly scribbles in a small notebook and glances toward every hushed conversation nearby.

> [!npc]- Ettain (Male)
> This half-elf balances on a stool in the corner, hammering a loose floorboard back into place. Wood shavings dust his clothes, and a pouch of handmade nails hangs from his belt.

> [!npc]- Korin the Chanteyman (Male)
> A dragonborn bard tunes a battered lute near the hearth. His resonant hum echoes through the tavern, carrying the weight of both sorrow and celebration.
> - [?] If asked, Korin shares that he lost his family to cultists, and many of his sea shanties carry hidden laments.
