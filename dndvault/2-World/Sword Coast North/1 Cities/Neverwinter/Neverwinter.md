> [!readaloud]  
> "As the road crests the final hill, the city of Neverwinter unfolds before you like a painting sprung to life. Great stone bridges span the river that runs through its heart, connecting bustling districts and towering spires. Steam rises from the cobblestones in places where the land still remembers the fire beneath, and the scent of sea air mixes with incense, horses, and fresh-baked bread. Ships crowd the harbor, flags snapping in the wind, while voices in a dozen tongues echo from markets and alleyways alike. Above it all looms Castle Neverâ€”silent, broken, and watching."
