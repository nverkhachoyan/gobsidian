## Story

Umbrage Hill rests on the remnants of a dwarven conflict between two dwarven clans.  The umbrage between the two clans is the reason why this area was named Umbrage Hill.  Now after many years, a Wind-Mill rests here, with the ruins of a house and several dwarven cairns. 

The windmill at Umbrage Hill is said to be haunted by the spirits of the fallen dwarves, their restless souls still seeking vengeance for the ancient conflict. Locals tell stories of mysterious shadows moving through the night, eerie whispers on the wind, and strange lights flickering in the darkness.

Despite its spooky reputation, Umbrage Hill has become a popular destination for thrill-seekers and adventurers looking to uncover the secrets of the past. Some believe that hidden within the ruins lies a great treasure, while others seek to communicate with the spirits that linger in the shadows.

But beware, for those who dare to tread upon Umbrage Hill may find themselves faced with more than just ghostly apparitions. The land itself seems to hold a malevolent energy, as if it remembers the bloodshed and betrayal that once stained its soil.
