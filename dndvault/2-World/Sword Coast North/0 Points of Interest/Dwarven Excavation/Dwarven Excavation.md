## Overview

The **Dwarven Excavation**, is the site of an old settlement that no longer exists.  It used to be a community of prospecting dwarves who worshipped and obeyed their deity, **Abbathor**, the deity of jealousy and greed.  The community had a large temple which priests would often make blood sacrifices to appease their deity. However, one day Abbathor was not pleased with the amount of sacrifices that were conducted and caused an avalanche which killed the inhabitants, sealing off many areas and leaving the settlement in a state of ruin. 

Now, centuries later, the **Dwarven Excavation** has become a popular site for archaeologists and treasure hunters looking to uncover the secrets of the past. The site is filled with hidden chambers, trapped corridors, and valuable relics waiting to be discovered.

As you venture deeper into the **Dwarven Excavation**, you may come across traps set by the dwarves to protect their treasures. Pressure plates, collapsing ceilings, and poisonous gas are just a few of the dangers that await those who dare to explore.

But for those brave enough to face the challenges of the **Dwarven Excavation**, great rewards await. From rare gems and precious metals to ancient scrolls and magical artifacts, there is no telling what treasures may lie hidden within these ancient ruins.
